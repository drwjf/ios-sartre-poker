SARTRE iOS Poker App
====================

This app allows you to play heads-up (1v1) limit poker against SARTRE, a research poker bot developed by the University of Auckland Game AI Group.

SARTRE is a Case Base Reasoning (CBR) poker bot which uses a database of previously encountered hands to make decisions in gameplay. SARTRE had demonstrated that it is a relatively hard opponent against other poker bots in poker AI competitions and is also a challenging opponent for humans.

No real money transactions are involved in this game and it is purely for enjoyment of the individual.
No adverts or in-app purchases.
